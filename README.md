# SIFT_BoW_SVM_Object_Classification
SVM is used to classify 4 types of objects; airplanes, cars, faces, and motorbikes using Bags of Features (Dictionaries). Moreover, K-means and Means-Shift algorithms are used (cooperatively and/or separately) for clustering keypoints-based and dense SIFT descriptors.
